## Git stuff
Normal Workflow:
- `git pull` to get the latest changes from github
- do whatever work you're doing
- `git status` just because
- `git add -A` will add all changed files to the commit you're about to do
- `git commit -m "your message here"` 
- `git pull` just incase any changes have been pushed since you started working
- `git push`
